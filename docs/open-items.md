# Open items

What's still open in the Blueprint app (the Agent Architecture Guide). Kept up
to date as work lands: items move to **Done** with their commit, and new gaps
are added as they're found.

Last updated: 2026-10-16, after the quality-and-reliability methods (uncommitted). Items are renumbered as they close; the Done section names what each commit covered.

## Next up

1. **Advice must follow the decided approach, not the answers' shape.** When
   the AI decision turns a "judgement" task into plain automation (seen twice
   on the transformer-load test, 2026-10-16), the result still shows AI-only
   gotchas (G3 incoming instructions, G4 prompts leaking data, G19 model
   choice) and F2 says "run the playbook in Claude with the most capable
   model". `ai(a)` and F2 in `src/lib/rules.ts` read `a.shape`; they should
   read the draft's approach once the decision is applied. Add a test: an
   automation decision over judgement answers yields no AI gotchas or steps.
2. **Designs must keep the decided shape.** The AI design can drop part of the
   shape the decision chose; for customer emails, the decision said "sort
   first, then the agent" and the design left out the sorting step. Require it
   in the design limits (`server/design.ts`, `checkDesign` in
   `src/lib/design.ts`), now that designs pass first time far more often.
3. **AI-decision mode for the evaluation.** `npm run eval:guide` still scores
   the rules. Add a mode that scores the AI's decisions on the 24 synthetic and
   7 source-backed cases, so the two can be compared.
4. **Requirements question in plain English.** Options such as "AI-generated
   code must run in an isolated, restricted environment" and "partition-aware
   backfills" don't fit a business owner, and appeared even for a dental
   clinic. Reword or narrow them (`src/lib/questions.ts`, `requirements`).

## Improvements

5. **The rules' own designs can't pick a statistical method.** Only the AI
   design can choose a control chart, capability index, reliability model or
   risk ranking (`FIXED_METHODS` in `src/lib/design.ts`), because the rules
   read answers, not the task's words. A rule that reads the task text the
   way retrieval does (`statisticalTask` in `server/knowledge.ts`) could put a
   control-chart decision in the rules' baseline for monitoring tasks, so the
   published site (no AI) gets it too.
6. **Automation decisions repaired every time.** On both transformer-load
   runs the first AI decision was rejected with "Plain automation started
   this way uses 'pipeline'" and fixed in the repair round. Say in the
   decision prompt (`server/decide.ts`) that automation always takes the
   pipeline shape, so the repair round and its wait are not needed.
7. **Faster decisions.** Each decision reads about 28,000 tokens, mostly 22
   knowledge-base chunks (`DECIDE_CHUNKS` in `server/decide.ts`). Fewer, better
   chosen chunks would cut the wait, at the cost of less research per decision.
8. **Kit sections dropped for one long item.** A "build notes" section was
   dropped because one item was too long; shorten over-long items instead, as
   design labels now are (`checkKitText` in `src/lib/kittext.ts`).
9. **Scale the delivery contract to the design.** It asks for a browser app by
   default even for plain automation or a manual playbook, and its one example
   is resume tailoring (`src/lib/delivery.ts`).
10. **Budget question.** Cost and effort estimates exist; a budget answer could
   then flag an estimate over budget and suggest cheaper choices.
11. **Harder benchmark cases.** The n8n/Airflow and n8n/LangGraph pilots tie
   because every case is easy. Add a crash mid-run, an approval that waits
   overnight, and the same event delivered twice; then show scoped benchmark
   evidence in the app.
12. **Audit other rule overlaps.** H1/H4 lost advice by "first match wins"
    (fixed with H6). Check the agent main-tool rules (TL5 to TL7) and others for
    the same problem.

## Checks not yet done

13. **Phone width** for the split page and the system map.
14. **"How the guide decides" draw.io diagram** predates H6 and AI decisions;
    regenerate it if it's still needed.

## Larger, later

15. **Sharing.** The published site has no AI and there is no hosted backend;
    History is per browser; a system link runs to 3,000+ characters.
16. **Multi-job systems.** Jobs connect only by handoffs (no shared component
    such as one approved-vendor gateway); at most four jobs; going back from a
    later job restarts the split from job 1.
17. **Model and product names** are updated by hand (`LAST_REVIEWED`, M01, M04)
    and need re-checking before each release.

## Parked by the owner

18. **AI design rejections** (task chip "Reduce AI design rejections by
    checkDesign"). Partly addressed in `8ccbda3`: misused tool steps and long
    labels are now corrected. Missing research citations still send a design
    back for repair.
19. **Independent review** of the 14 deferred manual evaluation checks.

## From reviewer feedback on the Kushim deliverable (2026-10-14)

Most of this landed as general rules (see Done). What remains:

20. **Precondition gates.** A requirement that must hold before processing
    (a notice live for N days per requisition) is a gate on the whole flow,
    not a step that fires and proceeds. Nothing expresses this yet; the
    opt-out branch from the same feedback is done (AU12's "Human review on
    request" gate).
21. **Jurisdictions and regulatory mapping.** The location question is a
    single answer; a business in two jurisdictions (New York and Dublin) can't
    say so, so the design can't say where each region's data is processed.
    Chunk D04 lists what is high-risk but not the deployer obligations
    (Arts 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 26). Where: `src/lib/questions.ts`,
    `knowledge/chunks/08-deployment-and-data/D04`.
22. **Counterfactual tests and a shadow-mode period in the kit.** AU12 asks
    for outcomes compared across groups; the kit's test set could include
    name-swap and counterfactual pairs and a shadow-mode first phase that
    produces the first comparison data. Where: `evals/examples.csv` in the
    kit (`src/lib/starter.ts`, `server/kit.ts`).
23. **The AI design's checker.** The rules' baseline picks an independent
    checker; an AI-drafted design's checker step is picked without knowing
    the producer, so it can coincide. Pass the producer into `pickModel` in
    `src/lib/design.ts` as `evaluator()` does.

## Done

- (uncommitted, 2026-10-16) **Quality control and reliability methods.** Three
  knowledge chunks from the SYSEN 5300 course notes (Q01 control charts and
  run rules, Q02 capability, Q03 reliability, system structure and FMEA; source
  `sysen-2026-5300-notes`); four no-AI methods in the catalog (control chart,
  capability index, reliability model, risk ranking) allowed on fixed and
  decision steps; retrieval reserves Q01 to Q03 for every design without AI
  and for any task whose words are about measurements, defects or failures
  (`statisticalTask`, `taskText` in `server/knowledge.ts`, used by decide,
  design and kit); the design prompt asks for the chart, index or model by
  name. Vitest no longer runs the desktop app's in-repo worktrees
  (`vite.config.ts`). Tests: `tests/quality-methods.test.ts`.
- (uncommitted, 2026-10-16) The jobs page moved from `#/guide/split` to
  `#/guide/jobs`: it shared its URL with the `split` question ("how do the
  parts relate"), so every judgement-shaped task hit a blank page at question
  3. `tests/router.test.ts` now checks every question has its own URL.
- (this commit) The rules' version of a result no longer waits for the AI
  version's build, so its kit (often a different main tool) can be opened;
  when the AI's main tool differs from the rules', the shortlist shows the
  rules' tool as the alternative; the switch names where it leads ("See the
  rules' version, built in Hermes Agent").
- `e56d5f3` An AI design's over-long step text is shortened at a word
  boundary instead of failing the design, and a missing field is named.
- `279381b` **Decisions about people, and reviews that
  mean something.** A "decides or recommends something about a person" risk
  answer; AU12 (cap at 2, adverse outcomes confirmed with evidence, human
  review on request, proxy details stripped, outcomes compared across groups,
  versions pinned), G33, F4; the evidence-packet step before any AI step;
  AU13 designed review for every level-2 design; AU14 credential scoping
  wherever AI acts behind an approval; independent checker with fixed checks
  when the stakes are high, as a rule and as an AI-decision limit; BUILD.md
  pins versions and keeps a decision record; the kit notes how to retire the
  practice it replaces. From the reviewer feedback this covers: safeguards as
  mechanisms (redaction step, credential scopes, every output approved),
  designed review, independent checker, version pinning and the decision
  record ("audited" is signalled by the answer), the opt-out branch, and
  retiring what the system replaces. It also closes the earlier "firm limit
  for checking sensitive work" item.

- `8ccbda3` AI makes the decisions within the rules' limits; decision and design
  slips corrected instead of rejected; cogitating animation; growing start box;
  short task titles.
- `9057efb` How it decides page describes what AI does.
- `b79a097` Haiku 4.5 replaced with Haiku 5.5; DeepSeek-V3.2 with V4-Pro.
- `03a0864` Workflow opens on the diagram, walkthrough button in its corner.
- `e4e610f` One-option shortlists hidden; raw benchmark trials kept out of git.
- `8606485` Survey progress-bar spacing restored.
- Earlier in this workstream: multi-job systems and the system map, H6 hosting
  rule, cost and effort estimates, draw.io exports.
